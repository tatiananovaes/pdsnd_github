# **Bikeshare Project**
This script provides descriptive statistics about data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington, in an interactive way with the user.

### Datasets
Three files have been used, one for each city, and all three of them contain the same core six columns: Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station, and User Type.

### Credits
Refactoring in the input code was possible due to an contribution from Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1075652/using-the-and-and-not-operator-in-python)
