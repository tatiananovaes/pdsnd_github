# **Bikeshare Project**

This script provides descriptive statistics about data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington, in an interactive way with the user.

This project has been made for the Programming for Data Science Nanodegree Program, from Udacity.

## Datasets

The data has been provided by Motivate (https://www.motivateco.com/), and some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity Team to condense the original files. 
Three files have been used, one for each city, and all three of them contain the same core six columns: Start Time, End Time, Trip Duration, Start Station, End Station, and User Type.

## Credits

Refactoring in the input code was possible due to an contribution from Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1075652/using-the-and-and-not-operator-in-python)

## Dependencies

The script uses Python 3, Numpy, Pandas, and Time installed using Anaconda, and a terminal application.
